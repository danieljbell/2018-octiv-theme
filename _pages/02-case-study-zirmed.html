    <p>Before Octiv, ZirMed used offline Word documents to create contracts. With Octiv, the contract process is completely online and takes just minutes.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>ZirMed relies on Salesforce as its CRM and SteelBrick as its CPQ solution. The missing piece was a product that integrated seamlessly with its existing solutions to create sales assets using existing data, then push that data back to Salesforce. The sales and leadership teams also valued visibility into deals throughout the sales process.</p>
        <p>Before Octiv, ZirMed used a solution that merged data into a pre-formatted Word document or PDF. The assets were then delivered via email attachment, where they essentially dropped into a black hole—reps had no visibility into client engagement with sales documents. This inefficient process made it difficult to ensure that sent contracts would be viewed and signed, which endangered deals at the most critical point of the sales cycle.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>ZirMed’s reputation as an innovative tech company in a changing industry required leadership to consider more sophisticated solutions for creating and delivering sales assets. They needed a better way to present client-facing documents. ZirMed added Octiv to their sales tech stack, and it now addresses every stage of the sales cycle. Salesforce serves as the company’s single source of truth, SteelBrick makes it easy to create accurate and price-compliant quotes, and DocuSign provides secure and reliable electronic signatures. With Octiv, salespeople can use data from SteelBrick and Salesforce to create and deliver personalized contracts that are completed with e-signatures from DocuSign.</p>

    <p class="octiv-block-statement">We previously used another solution that merged data into a pre-formatted Word document or PDF. The output looked fine, but it certainly wasn’t impressive. We’d deliver the assets via email attachment. From there, they would drop into a black hole…we had no visibility into client engagement with our sales documents.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>The result for ZirMed’s sales team is a significant increase in efficiency and accuracy. Once a contract is signed, that data is instantly pushed back to Salesforce and the opportunity is updated. Reps no longer have to email, fax, scan, save locally, find the Salesforce opportunity, upload the signed document, and change the opportunity stage to reflect the win. Octiv has dramatically reduced the number of steps for generating a document in Salesforce and then delivering via DocuSign. The rep has real-time intelligence on document views and the duration of those views. Once the signature is received, everything lands back in Salesforce without the rep lifting a finger.</p>
        <p>The combination of Salesforce, SteelBrick, Octiv and DocuSign gives ZirMed the ability to streamline the sales process for its sales team and its clients, who now rely on technology to work more efficiently.</p>
