        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>When the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was implemented in 2015, healthcare compliance had to evolve accordingly — and so did UnifyHR. As hundreds of thousands of employers scrambled to find a solution for 2015 reporting, and UnifyHR couldn’t get their proposals done fast enough. At that point, they were using Microsoft Word for manual proposals and contracts.</p>
        <p>Not only was UnifyHR struggling with an inefficient document workflow, but its CRM was also more of a burden than a resource. After creating the proposals and contracts in Word, teams would backtrack and enter information in their CRM — after the fact — on a monthly basis. They couldn’t use their CRM in a functional, up-to-date way to efficiently track opportunities. After that year’s reporting was completed, it was time to gain some efficiencies with an integrated solution. </p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>UnifyHR found an integrated solution in Octiv. Not only did they use Octiv to build out their contracts and proposals, but they also worked with their implementation manager to configure Salesforce in a way that accurately captured data instead of working backwards. This meant a change in the way their teams worked, but the changes helped UnifyHR to better utilize not only Octiv but also their CRM. They update their CRM and personalize their communication templates based on their conversations, all of which takes just five minutes. </p>
        <p>In addition to creating communications templates, UnifyHR updated their redlining process. Now, teams are always working in the most up-to-date version of a contract.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>With Octiv, UnifyHR managed to reduce administrative burden while expediting and tracking its proposal, contracting and reporting processes. Reporting historically took a few days to complete, but with Octiv, it now takes less than 30 minutes. </p>
        <p>Because Octiv takes the burden of building and tracking proposals and contracts off their plates, UnifyHR can use their extra time to focus on what really matters: developing relationships with both current and potential clients to help them understand and navigate the healthcare compliance industry. Octiv gives them more time to address individual questions and concerns, which makes for better relationships with clients.</p>
