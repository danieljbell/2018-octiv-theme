        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Realync sells its platform to leasing teams, apartment managers and owners. Often times, these owners and managers operate a full portfolio of properties, and may need separate terms and agreements for each property, resulting in hundreds of pages of documents. Realync was creating templates in Microsoft Word, manually filling the information needed for deals, exporting the documents as PDFs then sending those PDFs as email attachments. From there, prospects would need to download pages and pages of documents, and either print for wet signatures, or upload pages individually to their own electronic signature solution.</p>
        <p>Managing all the different versions of each document and creating new PDFs for each version became a nightmare, while legality questions arose as well. Some customers were only printing and signing the signature pages of multi-page agreements to save time and confusion, but without the entire document, Realync had to question whether the deals were even legally-binding at that point.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>Realync needed a solution that would speed up the drafting process, especially for deals requiring multiple contracts and signature blocks. Octiv’s integration with DocuSign allows prospects to sign quickly and easily, while erasing the legality issues Realync faced previously. Without an enterprise CRM solution, Realync also needed a way to autofill information throughout contracts. Octiv’s custom variables feature worked as a quick fix, while the copy to assets feature assisted in pulling in customized assets—such as redlined MSAs—into documents.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>Just 11 days after purchasing Octiv, Realync was able to create a 99-page document with 17 signature blocks in less than 30 minutes. The client was then able to review and sign the document in less than five minutes. Octiv has simplified the drafting process for consolidated contracts, saving Realync time and making it easier for clients to review longer documents. The DocuSign integration also makes it a breeze for clients to e-sign 20 or more signature blocks in less than a minute.</p>
