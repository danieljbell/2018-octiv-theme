    <p>Before Octiv, Galvin Technologies used Word document templates to create contracts in 45 minutes. With Octiv, the company now creates contracts with the click of a button.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>While Galvin Technologies has always been a leader in helping others implement Salesforce, the company faced a challenge when it came to automating its own process to create contracts, proposals and other documents. With multiple outdated versions of Word documents floating around the company, many opportunities arose for errors and inconsistencies, like using the wrong boilerplates and templates.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>The company turned to Octiv knowing that the platform already integrated seamlessly with Salesforce. Galvin Technologies was looking for a solution where they could click a button and it would generate all the documentation that they needed, and then send it to the client.</p>
        <p>From there, the implementation process was simple because Galvin Technologies’ data was already in Salesforce. Galvin Technologies wanted their sales team to avoid the inevitable “bottleneck” in the process: the waiting around and inefficiency of offline documents, proposals and contracts. With Octiv’s ability to track engagement, the client services knew as soon as the necessary paperwork was completed, which moved it right along to the accounting team for approval, which moved it right along to the production team. This eliminated the process of waiting for emails and updates, and thus eliminated the bottleneck.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>Before Galvin Technologies integrated Octiv with its Salesforce workflows, creating and sending out a contract alone would take up to 45 minutes, and the overall process could take hours. Now, it’s just a click of a button, and Octiv generates all the necessary documents needed to send to a client.</p>
