    <p>Before Octiv, it took SmartBrief as much as a day to create proposals. With Octiv, SmartBrief creates proposals with the click of a button.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>SmartBrief’s sales team needed a standardized system from which to generate, deliver and track proposals. Providing consistent branding, language and pricing were also important elements to improving the customer experience. It took SmartBrief sellers anywhere from a day to parts of several days to create a proposal. Sales reps used PowerPoint to create proposals and delivered them via email attachments, taking time away that could have been spend on sales calls or generating new business. Tracking proposals was impossible, and there was no way to determine how prospects interacted with the documents. Without a centralized way to keep track of proposals, salespeople were in the dark about when proposals were viewed and unable to easily access them when needed.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>SmartBrief’s original solution plan was to create a “proposal desk,” which would consist of a team tasked with created proposals. A CRM team member discovered Octiv at Dreamforce, and realized they could use the platform to achieve the team’s goal of streamlining the proposal process and to standardize branding and design. Octiv’s integrations with Salesforce meant SmartBrief could continue everything they were already doing in Salesforce in a more streamlined way.</p>
        <p>Octiv’s proposal templates allow SmartBrief’s proposal team to create attractive, easy-to-navigate documents that are delivered with the click of a button. The templates and repository of files, assets and content allow SmartBrief much faster than when they were starting PowerPoints from scratch each time.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>With Octiv, SmartBrief has been able to standardize its proposal creation and delivery process, streamline its proposal process, creating and sending more than 600 proposals each quarter. SmartBrief wins over 30 percent of the proposals created in Octiv. The company’s average deal size doubled as well. They can now put larger opportunities in front of clients since it’s easier to present more options.</p>
        <p>Proposals aren’t the only process Octiv has been able to streamline and improve for SmartBrief. Each of the 200 newsletters the company produces requires a media kit, which had to be updated separately. Thanks to Octiv’s seamless Salesforce integration, all 200 media kits are generated from a single Octiv template and updated through Salesforce.</p>
        <p>SmartBrief didn’t stop at media kits, though. They used Octiv to create a new version of their Insertion Order, and instituted their Master Service Agreements and Statements of Work for all of their content marketing products to be built and delivered in Octiv. Teams across the entire organization now utilize Octiv in some capacity as SmartBrief expanded its use of the platform from proposals to almost every major document.         </p>
