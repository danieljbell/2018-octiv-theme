        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>From the time TMI received a lead to the time it went out to a client could take as long as <strong>nine calendar days</strong>. TMI needed a way to streamline their process to make it easier and faster to get a response to a client. They also needed a solution that would seamlessly integrate with their CRM.</p>

      <div class="octiv-icon-content-container">
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>Octiv shortened TMIâ€™s sales cycle by streamlining their contract workflow, taking the 10-to-15-minute contract creation process down to just the <strong>click of one button in Salesforce</strong>. Octiv helped TMI cut back in administrative work, both in training reps on sales tech and in the sales cycle.</p>
