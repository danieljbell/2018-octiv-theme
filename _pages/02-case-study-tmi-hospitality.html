    <p>Before Octiv, responding to leads took as many as 9 days. With Octiv, response time has shrunk to less than one day.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>In the hotel business, time is money &ndash; and with the rise of hotel websites that help customers book rooms and events online, the company risked losing two of its most valuable resources.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>&ldquo;From the time we received a lead to the time it went out to the client,&rdquo; said TMI Hospitality sales center director Kimberly Busch, &ldquo;it would take as many as nine calendar days.&rdquo;</strong></p>
        <p>&ldquo;Our biggest challenges were inefficiency and streamlining,&rdquo; Kimberly said. &ldquo;How could we make it easier and faster to get those responses back out to the client?&rdquo; That question prompted TMI to research solutions that would integrate seamlessly with Salesforce, the company&rsquo;s CRM. &ldquo;I started researching solutions, and we looked at three,&rdquo; said Kimberly. &ldquo;We focused on four things: email notifications, pushing data back to Salesforce, eSignature and interactive capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>While evaluating Octiv, Kimberly checked off every box on her list, and even found solutions to problems she hadn&rsquo;t identified before. &ldquo;It just didn&rsquo;t make sense to have to add several apps for Octiv&rsquo;s all-in-one solution. That&rsquo;s what Octiv has been for us &ndash; and we&rsquo;ve been able to be that for our clients and hotels in return.&rdquo;</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>Although TMI chose Octiv to shorten its sales cycle, it&rsquo;s helped accelerate sales tech training as well. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done a complete restructure of our team,&rdquo; Kimberly said, &ldquo;and four team members had to learn how to use Octiv with Salesforce.&rdquo; Instead of several training sessions, the new team members simply had to be shown how to click around in each system. &ldquo;Octiv was able to cut out a lot of the administrative work we&rsquo;d have had to go through for training. It was just like, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s where the button is, click that, and you&rsquo;re off and running!'&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Octiv has also enabled TMI to streamline its contracting workflow process. By integrating Octiv with Salesforce, salespeople slashed contract creation time. &ldquo;Before Octiv, it would take 10 to 15 minutes to create a contract,&rdquo; said Kimberly. &ldquo;Now, provided all the data is in Salesforce, all you have to do, literally, is click a button.&rdquo; TMI Hospitality has realized time savings in response time as well.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Since implementing Octiv, the nine-day response time has been shrunk to less than one.</strong></p>
        <p>Now that salespeople no longer have to manually enter data in multiple places, they spend significantly less time on administrative tasks and can focus on selling. &ldquo;I think about the actualized business that comes through, and the connections and relationships we&rsquo;re able to build,&rdquo; said Kimberly. &ldquo;It has been tremendous to see the efficiency &ndash; my team can do what they&rsquo;re supposed to be doing: following up, negotiating, not spending so much time pushing paper.&rdquo;</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>All that time saved has also led to better outcomes across the organization. &ldquo;We compared last year from January to October with this year, and we&rsquo;ve processed more leads,&rdquo; said Kimberly.<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>&ldquo;We saw a 25 percent increase in revenue and a 13 percent increase in room nights contracted.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>So, not only did we grow in the lead volume we were able to handle, we also became more efficient.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s led other areas of the company to request Octiv as well. &ldquo;We constantly get requests from our hotels asking, &ldquo;when do we get Octiv? When can we use this at the hotel level?&rdquo; We&rsquo;re looking at different ways to make that work.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>With those kinds of results, Kimberly is excited about what the future holds for Octiv and TMI.</p>
        <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve shown more value to our company as a department because we&rsquo;re able to do more,&rdquo; said Kimberly.</p>
