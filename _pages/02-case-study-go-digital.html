    <p>Before Octiv, G/O Digital created its slide decks in 30 minutes. With Octiv, creating a deck now takes less than 5 minutes.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>G/O Digital worked from a PowerPoint template they would re-edit over and over for each client. Each slide deck took around 30 minutes to create, and required salespeople to manually enter data from the company’s CRM, Salesforce. The large files were then sent as email attachments, which could lead to crashed servers and bogged down inboxes and outboxes. Visibility was also an issue, leaving salespeople unable to determine how prospects were engaging with the contracts they were sent.</p>
        <p>The process became unworkable, however, as demand grew and the company expanded into additional markets across the country. They needed to scale processes across the board, with a way to create, deliver and track documents directly from their CRM.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>G/O Digital found a solution in Octiv, with its ability to personalize documents with customer information directly from their CRM. This new process has increased accuracy and saved time, and since documents are viewed online, bulky email attachments are a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>After seeing how the Pre-Sales and Affiliates team was using Octiv to create documents with the click of a button, the Sales Operations and Analytics team implemented Octiv as well, bringing the entire sales process online and eliminating all manual tasks. Octiv’s electronic signature features and integration with Formstack has helped G/O Digital streamline and automate the entire contracting process.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>After implementing Octiv for both teams, G/O Digital was able to shave time off the creation and delivery of its sales documents, streamline the sales process and save its teams valuable time. Before Octiv, the pre-sales team spent as much as 30 minutes on each deck — now creating a deck takes as little as five minutes. Team focus has shifted from document creation to how they can use the improved data they collect to give customers what they need.</p>
        <p>Sales operations are now able to close more deals in less time. Creating contracts took salespeople about 15 minutes, but today it takes them five minutes or less. Octiv is now the only contracting solution the sales team uses, which ensures document accuracy and provides the insight salespeople need to follow up and improve customer experience.</p>
