        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>InsightSquared realized their multi-step contract creation process contained too many manual tasks, causing inefficiencies and inconsistencies at the contracting stage of the sales process. Sales reps would save a contract as a PDF, and attach it to an email to send to a prospect. The prospect would print it out, sign it, scan it and then email it back. Creating and sending PDF contracts also led to inconsistency and a lack of visibility. Revision control was an issue, as salespeople used outdated templates.</p>
        <p>In the worst case scenarios, the paperwork and slow signing process stood in the way of closing deals during a fiscal period, pushing deals out and impacting company revenue.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>InsightSquared needed a product that would remove the friction from the sales process and integrate seamlessly with Salesforce. They wanted to provide the sales team with a single solution to create, send and sign documents, simplifying the process for both salespeople and their customers.</p>
        <p>Octiv was the single platform, single template solution they needed. Octiv eliminated the confusions and risk of using incorrect or outdated templates. The Salesforce integration also enable InsightSquared to create a single document that acts as a universal template that will adapt itself to each and every sales opportunity. Octiv draws all of the necessary information from Salesforce.com, across different objects, which enables the InsightSquared sales team to create contracts in just a few minutes.

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>Since implementing Octiv, InsightSquared has seen a significant increase in its ability to quickly create accurate contracts. Along with an increase in accuracy, Octiv also provides the sales team a new level of speed: contracts can be generated, sent, signed and countersigned in a fraction of the time it took with PDFs.</p>
        <p>Before Octiv, it would take sales team members an average of an hour to prepare a contract, and as long as a day to receive a signature, review and countersign a contract. Today, it takes minutes to prepare a contract, as little as 30 seconds for a prospect to sign it, and countersignature can happen anytime, anywhere.</p>
