    <p>Before Octiv, the 360 Services sales team took 45 minutes to assemble proposals. With Octiv, the process takes 15 minutes from start to finish.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>To generate new proposals, 360 Services sales reps used old proposals created in Microsoft Word, changed the company name and manually added photos to personalize the documents. The process was time-consuming and left room for human error. The process was inefficient, and left the team without a way to track when customers opened and read documents, and sometimes even contributed to lost leads. In addition to losing leads, inaccurate proposals sometimes made their way to prospects.</p>
        <p>360 Services wanted to increase the trackability, speed and accuracy of proposals and contracts to grow the business. They also wanted to establish the company as an innovative brand by using technology to engage customers.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>360 Services needed a proposal and sales document solution that would work seamlessly with its CRM, allow its mobile workforce to access and deliver documents in the field, and increase proposal accuracy and speed. After deciding to go with Octiv, 360 Services implemented the solution in the morning and sales reps started sending proposals out of Octiv that afternoon.</p>
        <p>The sales team now uses Octiv to create branded proposals for prospects. Clients comment on the personalization of the proposals and are impressed that 360 Services created something tailor-made just for them. 360 Services even adopted a new word to refer to their proposals: “Octives.”</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>Since adopting Octiv, 360 Services has seen an increase in the number of proposals its sales team generates. The team saves time and accuracy has improved significantly. 360 Services has offices across five states, and the CEO relies on Octiv to help him manage from afar with better insights into the pipelines of his sales teams. At any time, he can check on the number and status of proposals sent to prospects at any of the five locations.</p>
        <p>After the first three months of using Octiv to create, deliver and track proposals, 360 Services was able to cut its proposals creation time from an average of 45 minutes to just 15 minutes: a 69 percent decrease in document creation time. Saving this much time enables sales reps to serve more clients and close more deals.</p>
