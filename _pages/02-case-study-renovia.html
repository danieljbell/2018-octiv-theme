        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Manual workflows were holding up both Renovia’s sales and production teams. While they used Salesforce as the main platform for their customers, the company then used this customer information to create all of their documents in Word. Inefficiencies developed in the time it took to make changes in proposals, and when production managers submitted work orders on the back end. Renovia decided it was time to align its front- and back-end systems with a digital document solution.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>Renovia needed a solution that could leverage date in Salesforce to quickly auto-generate proposals, which in turn would create a work order document that would then be sent to the contractor executing the work. With Octiv, Renovia achieved consistency via its integration with not only Salesforce but with Box.com, the online repository Renovia uses for content like photos. Each work site is physically inspected and photos are taken for documentation, and Renovia did not want to lose this process. Octiv was flexible and worked through a solution that would be the best fit for Renovia’s existing processes.</p>
        <p>An added bonus for the Renovia team was Octiv’s engagement tracking features on documents. The ability to track when customers receive and open documents, and to see where they spend the most time in the document was an added benefit of the Octiv platform.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>Before Octiv, creating proposals took 20 minutes or more. With Octiv, Renovia reduced proposal creation time by 50%. Each proposal is dynamically generated through Salesforce, eliminating the errors introduced with Word documents. And the company uses Octiv for more than just proposals: the Salesforce-Octiv integration allows Renovia to automatically generate work orders and invoices as well. By leveraging Octiv as a tool for its success, Renovia generated 428 documents in 60 days, connected its sales and production teams with the power of consistent data and Salesforce, and gained back the most valuable resource they had lost: time.</p>
