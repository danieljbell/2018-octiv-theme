    <p>Before Octiv, Relevant took weeks to assemble paper binder quotes with as many as 500 pages. With Octiv, the online process of creating a quote takes as little as a single day.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>In a traditionally very paper-based industry, Relevant Solutions took the first big step into the digital world with Salesforce. The CRM provided a way to increase visibility across the organization and increased consistency, but a CRM along couldn’t solve all their problems. For some of Relevant Solutions’ larger products, the quotation process might feature a 400-500-page binder that’s revised three or four times. The proposed product packages offer detailed specs on equipment that can reach prices close a million dollars, and involves the input of everyone from engineers to account managers. The offline process of creating these documents required hours of manpower, sometimes adding up to several weeks before a bid was ready to deliver to a prospect.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>Relevant Solutions saw an opportunity to increase operational efficiency and revenue while moving toward a more sophisticated, tech-centered process and started the search for an online solution. The company also wanted to transform the way it mapped the buyer journey, track customer engagement and update messaging.</p>
        <p>The Octiv platform was and ideal solution, since it could use data existing in Salesforce to create online assets. With a central repository for all up-to-date product information and access from any device, account managers now use Octiv to replace offline binders with online templates and fill in prospect information directly from Salesforce. Salespeople can also track customer engagement with documents to determine the best times and ways to follow up.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>Relevant Solutions can now create branded online bids in an entirely new way. Since implementing Octiv and integrating it with Salesforce, Relevant Solutions has positioned itself as a standard-bearer in the oil and gas industry and slashed the time it takes to create quotes from weeks to less than a single day.</p>
