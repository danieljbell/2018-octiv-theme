    <p>Octiv and Conga take two different approaches to solving document generation challenges for organizations. Conga is considered to be a point solution that customizes documents or presentations by merging data directly from Salesforce into templates. Octiv is an all-in-one platform designed not only to auto-generate visually stunning online documents and presentations out of Salesforce, but also helps sales teams to organize, store and distribute selling materials. Octiv can also be used to capture a legally binding electronic signature, track when a document is opened and provides visibility into how long a recipient spent viewing specific pages of a document or slides of a presentation.</p>
    <p>Octiv has had the opportunity to win several customers that were previously Conga customers. Customers that switched from Conga to Octiv were looking for simpler administration of complex configuration options along with faster back-end response times. The Octiv solution addresses the enterprise user that is looking for an all-encompassing tool that enables a user to create, track, negotiate and sign documents online.</p>
