    <p>Before Octiv, Lindamood-Bell’s enrollment process was offline and took days or weeks to close. Today, the entire process is online and enrollment takes just minutes.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Lindamood-Bell’s paper-based enrollment process caused headaches for staff and students alike, and the company realized it needed a change. After migrating from a legacy system to Salesforce in late 2014, Lindamood-Bell was set with a single data source, but they needed a solution that could build complex documents with show/hide logic.</p>
        <p>Prior to Octiv, the company used a Word document template to fill in customer information, then printed and mailed the document to the customer. Customers signed a paper document and mailed it back to their chosen learning center location, making enrollment a days-long, offline process.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>By creating an online version of the enrollment agreement with Octiv, Lindamood-Bell slashed days from the enrollment process and made it easy for customers to complete and sign the documents with DocuSign in just minutes. It’s also a significant time-saver for the sales team, who had to manually input customer data from offline documents into Salesforce.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>Lindamood-Bell’s recommendation document was even more complex than the enrollment agreement. With 68 possible versions, an online document would require hundreds of fields and show/hide logic – but Octiv consolidated all 68 versions into a single online template. This made the migration from the company’s legacy system to Salesforce complete: because the output was identical and generated from Salesforce, salespeople could more easily adopt the CRM more quickly and easily.</p>
        <p>With Octiv, Lindamood-Bell has transformed not only its sales process, but its customer experience. Now that the company’s salespeople and customers can create, review, sign and send documents completely online, Lindamood-Bell is looking forward to how Octiv can impact every stage of the sales process.</p>
