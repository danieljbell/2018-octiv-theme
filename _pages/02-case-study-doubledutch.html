    <p>Before Octiv, DoubleDutch had an inconsistent proposal process. With Octiv, the proposal process is completely online and the sales team created more than 100 proposals in an hour.</p>

        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Offline, manual proposals slowed DoubleDutch's sales process and introduced errors. There was also no way for DoubleDutch sales reps to track proposal engagement. With fewer proposals being sent and no way to track the ones that were, DoubleDutch had to transform the way it created and delivered proposals in order to scale its process to meet the rapid growth in demand for its product.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>The sales team at DoubleDutch needed a solution that made proposal creation and delivery fast, simple and powerful. Giving their customers the ability to sign proposals and contracts anywhere, from any device, has provided even more time savings and accelerated the sales cycle. The implementation process took just over two weeks from first call to launch.</p>
