        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>After using a slide deck product to present more than a hundred personalized options for suite rental and other experiences, the IMS sales team realized they were spending hours sifting through a master deck with nearly 200 slides to find the appropriate content for prospects. <strong>They needed an efficient way to maintain accuracy and deliver personalized packages in a fraction of the time it took before.</strong></p>
