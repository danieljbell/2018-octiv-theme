        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>The Scale Computing sales team had a workflow with too many steps and not enough consistency. The result was a lengthy sales process which contributed to lost opportunities, a potential threat to the company’s growth.</p>
        <p>Scale’s sales proposal process was complicated and nearly impossible to scale. Sales professionals created their own proposals with a custom solution, causing inconsistency in messaging and pricing. This was exacerbated by a lack of visibility on what was delivered, which left sales leaders without a way to evaluate what proposal content was actually driving sales.</p>

        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>Scale Computing needed a solution that allowed sales professionals to maintain consistency and boost predictability with consistent proposals that provided correct pricing – all while making it faster for their sales team. Seamless integration with Salesforce CRM and automation was essential to give sales professionals the power to generate personalized proposals with the click of a button.</p>
        <p>Sales professionals were able to easily automate the creation of sophisticated proposals featuring different packaged solutions. With the Octiv multi-select feature, customers were able to simply click a checkbox to choose the most appropriate package and purchase the solution. Selections were automatically passed back to Salesforce, syncing the quote and completing the transaction. The time investment for sales professionals, from start to finish, was just five minutes.</p>

        <h4>The Results</h4>
        <p>After implementation, the Scale Computing sales team was able to close a significant amount of business just two days before the end of the quarter. After the first full quarter of using Octiv, Scale Computing had the largest revenue quarter in company history and accelerated its sales cycle by 53 percent when compared to deals closed without Octiv.</p>
        <p>Octiv has provided more insight into Scale’s buyers’ attitudes, helping them to shorten their sales cycle while closing more deals.</p>
